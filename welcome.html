<div class="post"><h2 class="posttitle">Notice</h2>
A user has recently asked me to implement a keyboard shortcut to add a page to Instapaper. I have been avoiding the implementation of a keyboard shortcut for a while because of the way  extension keyboard shortcuts currently work in Google Chrome. In order for an extension to detect keyboard shortcuts, it must inject a userscript into each website a user visits. This userscript would monitor the keyboard. In short, <span style="color:#F00;">if I implement keyboard shortcuts, my extension will need to request for <i>"Your data on all websites"</i></span>. I'm still debating whether or not I should implement shortcuts, but I just wanted to give you guys a heads up.

<div class="post"><h2 class="posttitle">V2.2:</h2>
The extension user interface has been modified to provide a more unified experience. Pages such as the options page should look more user friendly and easier.

<h2 class="posttitle">V2.1.1</h2>
Due to popular opinion, the Extension Updated Page (this page) no longer pops up immediately after an update. Instead, the Instapaper icon displays a "msg" badge, which will open the Instapaper Updated Page on click.

<h2 class="posttitle">V2.1</h2>
Version 2.0 was a huge upgrade which left plenty of room for improvement. One user, 2010 politely informed me that there was no feedback when the extension button is clicked until it is added. Another user, Andre, suggested that clicking the Instapaper button on the new tab page opened the instapaper site. I've accounted for both of these suggestions in this update.

<h2 class="posttitle">V2.0</h2>
With this breakthrough version, the extension interface has been completely recreated. The classic popup bubble has been replaced with Chrome-style extension badges. In addition, the options page has been heavily modified to accomodate the login.
